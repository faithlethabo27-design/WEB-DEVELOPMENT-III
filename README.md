Refinements and Improvements from Part 2 Feedback and Reflection

Implemented a responsive navigation bar with a “Menu” toggle button for mobile view using simple JavaScript.

Standardized the dark-theme styling across all pages for visual consistency.

Outcome:
The website now adheres to proper semantic HTML5 standards, scales smoothly across devices, and displays a cohesive visual identity.

Fixed structure errors and unified styling with other pages.

Embedded the official Google Form in a responsive <iframe> with proper sizing.

Added contact details (email and phone number) in a centered info box.

9. SEO Optimization

Refinement:

Used semantic HTML headings (<h1>, <h2>, <h3>) to improve content hierarchy.

Improved accessibility by using alt attributes for all images.

Added canonical URLs to avoid duplication in search results.

Outcome:
Website is now optimized for better discoverability and professional appearance in search engines.

10 Reflection

After reviewing lecturer feedback and self-assessment, I focused on ensuring structural correctness, consistent styling, and functional interactivity across all pages.
Although Part 2 was visually complete, several technical refinements were required to meet professional web standards — particularly responsiveness, SEO, and JavaScript integration.
The final website now demonstrates these improvements effectively and is ready for publishing.
